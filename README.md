## 📖 Understanding Script Types

### 🔴 Ruby Scripts

Ruby scripts come in two flavors, each with distinct capabilities:

| Type | Naming | Runs From | Requirements | Best For |
|------|--------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **UI Scripts** | `UI_script.rb` | Workgroup Client GUI | Standard license | Quick automation, interactive tasks |
| **Exchange Scripts** | `EX_script.rb` | Command line via `IExchange.exe` | Exchange license | Batch processing, headless automation |

#### 🎯 Running Exchange Scripts

Use this template `.bat` file to execute Exchange scripts:

```batch
@ECHO OFF
SET script=EX_script.rb
SET version=2021.1
SET bit=64
IF %bit%==32 (SET "path=C:\Program Files (x86)")
IF %bit%==64 (SET "path=C:\Program Files")
"%path%\Innovyze Workgroup Client %version%\IExchange" "%~dp0%script%" ICM
```

**Customize:**
- `script` - Your Ruby script filename
- `version` - Your Workgroup Client version
- `bit` - Architecture (32 or 64)

### 🔵 SQL Queries

Autodesk Water products use a specialized SQL dialect for powerful network operations:

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Select objects based on complex criteria
- ✅ Update multiple fields simultaneously  
- ✅ Chain operations with multiple clauses
- ✅ Save as reusable Stored Queries

**Query Structure:**
```sql
SELECT WHERE condition1;
UPDATE SET field = value WHERE condition2;
DESELECT WHERE condition3;
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 📐 Project Evolution

This repository is **growing organically** with the community. We may occasionally reorganize structure to improve usability. We'll minimize disruption, but please bookmark specific scripts rather than relying on deep links during early development.

### ⚖️ Liability & Support

- ✅ **Community-Driven**: Scripts are shared in good faith by Autodesk Support and community contributors
- 🔍 **Open Source**: All code is transparent and available for review
- ⚠️ **Use at Own Risk**: Autodesk is not liable for unintended consequences
- 🚫 **Not for Bespoke Projects**: Custom development requests should go through official Autodesk channels

### 🎓 Script Quality

Scripts are typically developed for specific customer use cases. While functional, they may not be fully optimized. We encourage the community to:

- 🔧 Suggest improvements via pull requests
- 🐛 Report issues for enhancement
- 📖 Add documentation and examples
- ⭐ Share your own optimizations
