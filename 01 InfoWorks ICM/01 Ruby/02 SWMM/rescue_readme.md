## How aee the Rescue statements used in the output reading code?

In Ruby, the rescue keyword is used for exception handling. It allows you to gracefully handle errors (exceptions) that may arise during the execution of your code.

Here's a breakdown of how rescue is used in your provided example:

# First Level of Rescue:

ruby
Copy code
rescue
    # This will handle the error when the field does not exist
    #puts "Error: Field '#{res_field_name}' does not exist for subcatchment with ID #{sel.id}."
    next
end
If any exception occurs inside the block of code preceding this rescue, the code inside the rescue block will be executed.
The commented-out puts statement indicates that this rescue block is likely intended to handle situations where a field does not exist for a given subcatchment.
The next keyword will skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the enclosing loop.

# Second Level of Rescue:

ruby
Copy code
rescue => e
    # Output error message if any error occurred during processing this object
    #puts "Error processing subcatchment with ID #{sel.id}. Error: #{e.message}"
end
This rescue is at an outer level, likely meant to catch exceptions for a larger block of code.
The => e part captures the exception object into the variable e, allowing you to access details about the exception. This is particularly useful when you want to print or log the error message, as shown in the commented-out puts statement.
The error message, which can be accessed with e.message, provides more specific information about the exception.
In Summary:
The rescue keyword in Ruby provides a mechanism to catch and handle exceptions. In the provided example, there are two levels of rescue. The inner rescue handles exceptions related to non-existent fields for subcatchments, while the outer rescue handles more general exceptions that might arise while processing a subcatchment. The actual error messages are commented out, so they won't be printed, but they give insight into the intended purpose of each rescue block.
