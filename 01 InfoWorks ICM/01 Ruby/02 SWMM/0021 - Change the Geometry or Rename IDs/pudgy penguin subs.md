## 💻 Complete Source Code

```ruby
# --- Universal Polygon Geometry and ID Changer ---
# This script modifies the boundary and ID of any selected subcatchment.
# It automatically detects the network type (SW or HW).
#
# It can reshape selected subcatchments into:
#  - A RECTANGLE that fits the original shape's extents.
#  - A regular POLYGON (triangle, pentagon, circle, etc.).
#  - A pre-defined CUSTOM shape (default is a penguin).

# --- USER CONFIGURATION ---

# 1. SHAPE AND ID SETTINGS:
#    - NEW_BASE_ID: The prefix for renaming selected subcatchments. A number will be appended (e.g., "Penguin_1", "Penguin_2").
#    - SHAPE_TYPE:  'RECTANGLE', 'POLYGON', or 'CUSTOM'.
NEW_BASE_ID = 'Penguin'
SHAPE_TYPE = 'CUSTOM'

# 2. POLYGON SETTINGS (only if SHAPE_TYPE is 'POLYGON'):
#    - For a triangle: 3, pentagon: 5, circle: 50, etc.
NUMBER_OF_SIDES = 6

# 3. CUSTOM SHAPE SETTINGS (only if SHAPE_TYPE is 'CUSTOM'):
#    - PRESERVE_AREA: If true, scales the shape to match the original subcatchment area
#    - SCALE: Base scale for the shape (used if PRESERVE_AREA is false)
#    - CUSTOM_SHAPE_POINTS: An array of [x, y] coordinates defining the shape.
#      - The origin [0,0] is the shape's center.
#      - For symmetrical shapes, you can define one half and the script will mirror it.
#        To do this, start and end the points list on the centerline (x=0).
PRESERVE_AREA = true
SCALE = 15.0
CUSTOM_SHAPE_POINTS = [
  # Detailed cute penguin shape (right half only - will be mirrored)
  
...
[Content truncated for brevity]
