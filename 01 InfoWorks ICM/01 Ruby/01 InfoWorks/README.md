    * `UI & EX` - Script can be ran in either UI or ICM Exchange
    * `UI` - Script is designed to run in the UI only
    * `EX` - Script is designed to run in the ICM Exchange only
    * `TBC` - Requires assessment from a maintainer
* Field `Category`:
    * `Network Data Bin`      - Reading raw binary data from the network. Makes no attempt to parse data.
